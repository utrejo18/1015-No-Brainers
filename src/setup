# identify your network
iwconfig

# for simplicity we will be using wlam0 as our interface, you should use your own that you find in your specific system

# Enter monitor mode
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0

# Scan for specific Networks nearby
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon

# after this command, you should be given a list of nearby wifi networks, along with their BSSID and the channel they are on, for simplicity, I will use a placeholder number, however
# you should use the numbers that load on screen once this command is executed

# Find the specific device you will be attacking, replace all numbers in this next command with the information that should have loaded in the earlier step
sudo airdump-ng --bssid 00:11:22:33:44:55 -c 2 wlan0mon
# where 00:11:22:33:44:55 is the BSSID and 2 is the channel
