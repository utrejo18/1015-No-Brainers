---------- BELOW IS HOW YOU WILL SETUP KALI LINUX ON YOUR RASPBERRY PI ----------
Many things are needed before you can begin. Keyboard & Mouse, display & display connection (HDMI), storage(SD Card), and Power supply.

TLDR; Download Kali Linux ARM for the specific raspberry pi you're using,
then flash it onto the micro SD card using a seperate program.
