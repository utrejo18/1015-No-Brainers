# Raspberry Pi Jammer

## How It works
Using raspberry pi to create a deauthentication attack at targeted devices connected to a network. We can essentially "trick" the wifi router to disconnect the target by
sending fake deauth packets to the targeted device as the wifi router. We can then continue to send out these deauth packets to continuously keep the device disconnected from the wifi. 

## Team members
- Vanessa Valdes - Research and development - Github: @vasliro

## Setup Instructions

## Technologies Used
- Kali Linux
- SD card
- raspberry pi
- USB Wifi Adaptor
- python
- scapy

## Project structure
Our main consists of a:
- README.md, which has a basic overview of the project.
- .gitingore, which contains files that git will be ignoring.
-  src folder, which contains copies of the code used
-  

## How to Contribute
Team members can contribute by researching the inner workings and usages for a fully operational rasp pi wifi jammer, setting up and running programs to test our prototype, and keeping track of new developments as we approach a final product.

## Current Status
Researching how to implemeent deauth attacks with raspberry pi and set up of software while we wait for the single board computer to arive.
